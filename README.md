# playground
Literally my playground, for things and bobs. Expect very very bad code. This is only public so i can clone it easily.

Below is a list of my current 'playground' projects.

## ResponsiveWeb

It's about time I got okay at web design, this is where I'll be experimenting with different CSS tricks for responsive web.

Most of this markup will make its way into the Sands News Project.

## EngimaMachine

This is my (very broken) EngimaMachine, like it just doesn't work at all.
